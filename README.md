NSDate-RelativeTime
===================

An `NSDate` category to generate relative time (or fuzzy time) strings from
dates.

## Usage
* Add `NSDate+RelativeTime.h` and `NSDate+RelativeTime.m` to the project or
add NSDate-RelativeTime to your Podfile.
* Import `NSDate+RelativeTime.h` into the class.
* Call the `relativeTime` method on an NSDate to get the relative time.

## Tests
The tests are in `NSDate+RelativeTimeTests.m` and require Kiwi to run.
